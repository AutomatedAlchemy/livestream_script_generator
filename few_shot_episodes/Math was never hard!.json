    "outline": "In this episode 'Math was never hard!' of 'Feynman & Friends', Richard Feynman, with guests Alice and Pete, demystifies mathematics through discussion and a puzzle involving shapes and colors. The show emphasizes understanding patterns, problem-solving, and making complex problems manageable, changing the guests' perspective on math and encouraging the Camera to embrace and enjoy mathematics.",
