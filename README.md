# Livestream Script Generator

## Introduction
The `livestream_script_generator` is a core component of an innovative project that uses local large language models to generate synthetic classroom discussions. These discussions are used in a Unity-rendered virtual environment for a 24/7 interactive livestream on YouTube, suitable for both public entertainment and private, custom lessons. This project is open-source under the GNU General Public License.

## Key Features
- **Python Scripts for Episode Generation**: Craft engaging and educational episodes.
- **REST API**: Seamlessly distribute content to the Unity environment.
- **Live Chat Scraper**: Integrate audience interactions by generating episodes based on livestream chat suggestions.
